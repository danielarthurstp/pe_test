Complete the given partial Systemverilog RTL code based on the specification doc/spec.md. The RTL code should be synthesizable. The PEs must be submodules as described on Specification.
Complete the module SystemVerilog RTL code using the specification at doc/spec.md. Be aware that the code must only use synthetizable code. The code may have submodules that are described on specification.
Make sure that the name of the files match with the following:
- Top:        pe_fp32.sv
- Submodules: 
              Adder_Tree.v
              Alignment_Shifter.v
              CEC.v
              CLA_AdderTree.v
              LZD.v
              compressor7to2.v
              csla.v
              multi12bX12b.v

The internal structure may be divided as you want, but as a hint, the submodules are described.

**Important**: This environment uses Icarus Verilog for testing. Avoid using SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) property/sequence syntax if adding assertions.$
